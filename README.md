# weather_app

A Flutter project that is built to search for the current weather in different cities and countries. This project is part of the online course I'm taking on Udemy, which focuses on Flutter development.  

## Key points I learned
- What is the best structure of a Flutter project where the files should be under different folders based on their content such as, views for the widgets that represnets screens, models for the classes that used to create objects for the displayed data, services for the classes that will be used for the request from the APIs etc.
- How to use the API to get data. This project [Weather API] (used https://www.weatherapi.com/).
- What is state management, and how to use it. In this project, bloc is used for state management. 
- How to make the App theme a dynamic theme.

## key self-development area
- Learning how to secure the API key when uploading the project to GitHub, which by the use of dotenv package.
